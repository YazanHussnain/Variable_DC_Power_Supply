0V-30V Variable DC Power Supply with maximum Load current of 1.5A
In this project we use 36V transformer that converts 230VRMS to 36V AC.
Then this 36V AC becomes the input of Full Wave Bridge Rectifier that converts the 36V AC into the Pulsating DC 36V.

For Pure DC we add 4700uF capacitor that reduce ripple in the circuit.
1mF capacitor next to 4700uF is also used to reduce ripple. In most applications, that 1mF capacitor is used if we add some circuit after 4700uF capacitor.
That circuit generate a ripple and that rippleis compensate by 1mF capacitor.

Next to 1mF capacitor we added a LM317S voltage regulator(1.5A)--1.25V - 30V--

Potentiometer and Resistance R1 creates a voltage divider circuit.
10uF capacitor reduce the ripple generated by Adjust pin of regulator.
Diodes D4 and D5 are used to prevent 10uF cap and 1mF cap from discharging at voltage regulator output.
